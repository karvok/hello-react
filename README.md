# Hello React

Hello React is a small project designed to reinforce understanding of fundamental React concepts:
- Passing props with JSX
- Handling DOM events
- Managing state with the useState hook
- Conditional rendering
- Creating controlled input components

## Purpose

This project was a coding challenge completed by [me](https://github.com/kazvee) as part of my learnings at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-flex-program).  
Using the starter code provided, full app functionality was implemented to fulfil the project requirements.

The app colour scheme has also been modified from the original -- just for fun! ðŸ¤©

## A note about `create-react-app`

For larger, production-ready applications, React's official documentation and best practices now recommend other ways to [Start a New React Project](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project)

The starter code provided was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and as there were no plans to scale this small project out, or add further customisation, create-react-app was a great quick and hassle-free way to quickly get a functional React app up and running for learning purposes.
